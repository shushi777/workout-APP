## E2E User Flows

### Flow 1: Standard Upload Flow ✓

1. User opens app at `/` → UploadPage renders
2. User drops video on DropZone → handleFileSelect called
3. ProgressBar shows upload progress (XHR onprogress)
4. Spinner shows during scene detection
5. Auto-navigate to `/editor?video=...&cuts=...`
6. TimelineCanvas renders cut points from query params
7. User tags segments in SegmentDrawer
8. User clicks Save → progress modal shows
9. Auto-navigate to `/library`
10. New exercises appear in ExerciseGrid

**Status: COMPLETE** - All transitions verified

### Flow 2: Share Target Flow ✓

1. User shares video from Android gallery
2. PWA service worker handles POST to /share-receiver
3. Video stored in IndexedDB
4. App.tsx detects ?shared= param
5. Retrieves video from IndexedDB
6. Sets uploadStore.sharedFile
7. Clears params, navigates to /
8. UploadPage auto-processes sharedFile
9. Continues from step 4 of Flow 1

**Status: COMPLETE** - IndexedDB chain verified

## Tech Debt (Non-Blocking)

### Phase 3: Timeline Editor

| Item | Impact | Recommendation |
|------|--------|----------------|
| Button zoom instead of pinch-to-zoom | Low | Functionally equivalent; pinch-to-zoom could be v2 enhancement |

| Item | Impact | Recommendation |
|------|--------|----------------|
| English text in LibraryPage | Low | Polish item - translate to Hebrew |
| English labels in SearchFilters | Low | Polish item - translate to Hebrew |
| Duplicated duration formatting | Low | Extract to utility function |

**Total: 4 items across 2 phases** - All polish, no blockers
